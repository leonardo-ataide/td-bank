Simulating an ATM terminal able to withdrawal and deposit money


As a new user you will get:

  * Cash reward of CAD250.00
  * Credit limit of CAD1000.00
  * Free Savings account
  
This Language C code was created to let the user play with their account, making deposits
and withdrawal money. If user try to withdrawal more than their credit limit, the transaction
won't be accepted. Furthermore, it is possible to play with wrong PIN number, wrong answers rather
than 'Y' or 'N' and also trying to deposit/withdrawal values that aren't integers.

Pros:
- There is a getch() function inside header file acting as the old <conio.h> library.
Where will be responsible to masking (*) password input.
- There are time_t and time(&now) to display current system date and time.

Cons:
- There are known issues in the code
- User may be prompted twice when inserting a correct password, in some occasions. (Will be fixed soon)
